# LCBw-word-engine-
LCB(w) is a compact evaluative framework that models linguistic tokens and actions as vectors in three‑dimensional. Unlike semantic dict/Legionaries that describe what a word means, LCB(w) describes what a word does by mapping each token to a vector representing its effects 
THE LCB(W) VECTOR EQUATION
V(t) = [wL * L(t)] + [wB * B(t)] - [wC * C(t)]

THE KEY (Variables of Action)
V(t): Resultant Trajectory
The net output of an action. It represents the direction and speed of an agent's movement through time.

L(t): Life / Legitimacy
The baseline of agency and existence. Increased through risk, biological continuity, and "winning" moves on the chess board.

Mapping: [L up] = Expansion of agency. [L down] = Erosion of capability.

B(t): Benefit / Directional Improvement
The perceived "gain" from an action.

Pro-Life B: Aligns with L (e.g., skill growth).

Anti-Life B: Opposes L (e.g., easy dopamine, parasitic gains).

C(t): Cost / Resource Expenditure
The irreversible spend of Time (t), Energy, and Opportunity.

Mapping: High-C represents high friction/risk. Low-C represents the "easy" path.

w (wL, wB, wC): The Weights
The "Belief Filter" installed by the environment (Parents, Media, Culture). These are multipliers that change how the agent perceives the variables.

Example: High wC makes a small effort feel impossible.

THE WORD ENGINE DESCRIPTION
The LCB(w) Word Engine is an Operational Dictionary. Instead of defining what a word means (static description), it defines what a word does (vector movement) to a human system.

To map a word, you must identify its impact on the three core variables:

Does it spend or save Cost (C)?

Does it provide a Benefit (B), and if so, is that benefit aligned with or against Life (L)?

Does the final result increase or decrease the agent's Legitimacy (L) on the board?

EXAMPLE MAPPING: SACRIFICE
Mapping: C(up), L(current-down), B(future-up).
Operational Definition: The intentional expenditure of finite resources (C) and current safety (L) to secure a higher-magnitude directional benefit (B) for the future system.
